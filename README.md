# 50DaysOfCode

On 18th January, 2022, I decided to start the 50 Days Of Code challenge. For the remainder of these 50 days, I will code and push at least one exercise a day into GitHub. The problems will be selected from Hackerrank, Exercism,  CodeAbbey and Codeforwin. Exercises will be chosen according to an escalating difficulty level. I expect this challenge to improve my productivity and programming skills, thus preparing me for a new semester in computer science.
